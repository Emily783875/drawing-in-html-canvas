A small website for drawing in the html canvas. You can change the canvas size. Drawing with mouse is preferred, but you can try using a tablet.
There are 3 brushes currently. You can change opacity, size and color jitter of brushes. There is also an eraser.
It has undo, redo and clear canvas functionality.
You can save the picture using save, if not, the drawing will be lost when closing or refreshing the website.
I might add the ability to load a picture in your canvas and the option to change the canvas color later, but they are not currently there.
